Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets.
Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge. 
However, despite the fact that that technology continuously evolves to handle data at a large-scale, leaders still face challenges with scalability and automation.
Data mining has improved organizational decision-making through insightful data analyses. 
The data mining techniques that underpin these analyses can be divided into two main purposes; they can either describe the target dataset or they can predict outcomes through the use of machine learning algorithms. 
These methods are used to organize and filter data, surfacing the most interesting information, from fraud detection to user behaviors, bottlenecks, and even security breaches.
When combined with data analytics and visualization tools, like Apache Spark, delving into the world of data mining has never been easier and extracting relevant insights has never been faster. 
Advances within artificial intelligence only continue to expedite adoption across industries. 
Data mining is the act of automatically searching for large stores of information to find trends and patterns that go beyond simple analysis procedures. 
Data mining utilizes complex mathematical algorithms for data segments and evaluates the probability of future events. 
Data Mining is also called Knowledge Discovery of Data (KDD).
Data Mining is a process used by organizations to extract specific data from huge databases to solve business problems.
It primarily turns raw data into useful information.
Data Mining is similar to Data Science carried out by a person, in a specific situation, on a particular data set, with an objective. 
This process includes various types of services such as text mining, web mining, audio and video mining, pictorial data mining, and social media mining.
It is done through software that is simple or highly specific. 
By outsourcing data mining, all the work can be done faster with low operation costs. 
Specialized firms can also use new technologies to collect data that is impossible to locate manually.
There are tonnes of information available on various platforms, but very little knowledge is accessible. 
The biggest challenge is to analyze the data to extract important information that can be used to solve a problem or for company development.
There are many powerful instruments and techniques available to mine data and find better insight fro$m it.
# Why is data mining important?
So why is data mining important? You’ve seen the staggering numbers – the volume of data produced is doubling every two years. 
Unstructured data alone makes up 90 percent of the digital universe. 
But more information does not necessarily mean more knowledge.
Data mining allows you to:
    # Sift through all the chaotic and repetitive noise in your data.
    # Understand what is relevant and then make good use of that information to assess likely outcomes.
    # Accelerate the pace of making informed decisions.
